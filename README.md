A program that generates a look-up chart for the game Chinese Idiom Solitaire.

Idiom Solitaire is a classic game among Chinese speakers. In this game, players take turns to come up with an four-character idiom that starts with the last (forth) character of the last player's idiom. This first player that fails to come up with one loses (and have to take a shot of spirit -- at least this was how I learned the game when I was 8 years old).

How is that a game? There are ~50,000 four-character idioms in the Chinese language (at least in the dictionary that I'm using in this repo), each of which start with one of ~3,500 unique characters. Thus, each round of game may end up with an unique path of idioms presented.

Technical details: The chart will be in PDF format, generated by `graphviz`, and is a direct graph. Notice that the graph might not be connected (in the graph-theory sense).
